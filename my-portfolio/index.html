                <div class="about">
                    <p>I discovered my passion for software development from the thrill of solving a complex puzzle. It all began with a simple algorithm problem from a mobile app, a challenge I stumbled upon before I had even dipped my toes into the realm of programming languages. Despite my limited knowledge, I was drawn to the process of logic and creativity, and the feeling of triumph when the code executed flawlessly. The challenge was like a puzzle, but the reward was in creating something that just worked.</p>
                    <p>Now, as a recent graduate transitioning from the healthcare field to software development, I'm brimming with eagerness to apply my acquired skills and knowledge in this dynamic domain. My proficiency extends across multiple languages, including JavaScript and Python, but my true joy lies in tackling complex problems and crafting innovative solutions. I'm enthusiastic about joining a team where I can leverage these skills, continually evolve as a software engineer, and contribute to the creation of transformative digital solutions.</p>

                            <h3>First Browser Game</h3>
                            <p>This game is inspired by the original game 'Flappy Bird' where your main objective is to dodge barriers to get as far as you can. However, there's a twist - there is an actual destination in this game. The idea for this game was born out of nostalgic memories of simpler times when games were less complex.</p>
