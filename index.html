                <!-- <p> I discovered my passion for software development from the thrill of solving a complex puzzle. It all began with a simple algorithm problem from a mobile app, a challenge I stumbled upon before I had even dipped my toes into the realm of programming languages. The challenge was like a puzzle, but the reward was in creating something that just worked. </p> -->
                <p> As a recent graduate of CSULB's bootcamp program, I'm transitioning from the healthcare field to software development with eagerness to apply my acquired skills and knowledge in this dynamic domain. My proficiency extends across multiple languages, but my true joy lies in tackling complex problems and crafting innovative solutions. </p>
                <p> Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through simple exercises like walks or a quick run. I cherish quality time with friends and family, exploring new restaurants, and traveling to experience different cultures and sights. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and passion for problem-solving in the tech industry üë®‚Äçüíª. </p>
