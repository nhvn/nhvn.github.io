              Get to Know Me
            </h3>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for software development from the thrill of solving
              a complex puzzle. It all began with a simple algorithm problem from a mobile
              app, a challenge I stumbled upon before I had even dipped my toes into
              the realm of programming languages. The challenge was like a puzzle, but
              the reward was in creating something that just worked.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a recent graduate of CSULB's bootcamp program, I'm transitioning from
              the healthcare field to software development with eagerness to apply my
              acquired skills and knowledge in this dynamic domain. My proficiency extends
              across multiple languages, but my true joy lies in tackling complex problems
              and crafting innovative solutions. I'm excited about joining a team where
              I can leverage these skills, evolve as a software engineer, and contribute
              to transformative digital solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through working
              out, running, and playing guitar. I cherish quality time with friends and
              family, exploring new cuisines, and traveling to experience different cultures
              and sights. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and passion for
              problem-solving in software development.

          What I Have Worked On
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a full-stack software engineer, I have successfully completed various software development projects, 
          which you can find in the section below. This website is one of my latest creations, showcasing my skills 
          and abilities in web development. I even implemented a night mode feature for the first time, which I think 
          is pretty cool. Besides working on more personal projects to expand my portfolio, I am also learning more about 
          algorithms and data structures to enhance my technical expertise. You can also visit my GitHub to see some of my 
          other work.

                  Welcome to my first game project, inspired by 'Flappy Bird', where I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and deployed using Firebase. The objective is to dodge barriers and reach a destination, capturing the essence of classic games. While simple, it was born out of a desire for nostalgia and a love for game development. At the time of typing this, it's only optimized for Windows computer.
