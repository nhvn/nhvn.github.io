              Get to Know Me
            </h3>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for software development from the thrill of solving
              a complex puzzle. It all began with a simple algorithm problem from a mobile
              app, a challenge I stumbled upon before I had even dipped my toes into
              the realm of programming languages. The challenge was like a puzzle, but
              the reward was in creating something that just worked.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a recent graduate of CSULB's bootcamp program, I'm transitioning from
              the healthcare field to software development with eagerness to apply my
              acquired skills and knowledge in this dynamic domain. My proficiency extends
              across multiple languages, but my true joy lies in tackling complex problems
              and crafting innovative solutions. I'm excited about joining a team where
              I can leverage these skills, evolve as a software engineer, and contribute
              to transformative digital solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through working
              out, running, and playing guitar. I cherish quality time with friends and
              family, exploring new cuisines, and traveling to experience different cultures
              and sights. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and passion for
              problem-solving in software development.

          What I Have Worked On
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have experience working on multiple software development projects and
          you can see some of my previous work and projects in the section below.
          However, I have chosen to dedicate my time to building this website as
          a demonstration of my skills and capabilities as a full-stack software
          engineer. I even added night mode for my website and I've never done that
          before, isn't that cool? While I will undertake additional personal projects
          in the near future to add more to my featured projects, my current focus
          is on studying algorithms and data structures to deepen my technical knowledge.
          But feel free to check out my other projects in my GitHub.

                  First Browser Game
                </h3>
                <p>
                  This game is inspired by the original game 'Flappy Bird' where your main
                  objective is to dodge barriers to get as far as you can. However, there's
                  a twist - there is an actual destination in this game. The idea for this
                  game was born out of nostalgic memories of simpler times when games were
                  less complex.
