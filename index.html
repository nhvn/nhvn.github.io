                <h3> Get to Know Me </h3>
                <!-- <p> I discovered my passion for software development from the thrill of solving a complex puzzle. It all began with a simple algorithm problem from a mobile app, a challenge I stumbled upon before I had even dipped my toes into the realm of programming languages. The challenge was like a puzzle, but the reward was in creating something that just worked. </p> -->
                <p> As a recent graduate of CSULB's bootcamp program, I'm transitioning from the healthcare field to software development with eagerness to apply my acquired skills and knowledge in this dynamic domain. My proficiency extends across multiple languages, but my true joy lies in tackling complex problems and crafting innovative solutions. I'm excited about joining a team where I can leverage these skills, evolve as a software engineer, and contribute to transformative digital solutions. </p>
                <p> Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through working out, running, and playing guitar. I cherish quality time with friends and family, exploring new cuisines, and traveling to experience different cultures and sights. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and passion for problem-solving in software development. </p>

          <h3> What I Have Worked On </h3>
          <p> As a full-stack software engineer, I have successfully completed various software development projects, which you can find in the section below. This website is one of my latest creations, showcasing my skills and abilities in web development. I even implemented a night mode feature for the first time, which I think is pretty cool. Besides working on more personal projects to expand my portfolio, I am also learning more about algorithms and data structures to enhance my technical expertise. You can also visit my GitHub to see some of my other work. </p>

                  <h3> My First Browser Game </h3>
                  <p> Welcome to my first game project called "Pumpkin Lost'te", inspired by 'Flappy Bird', where I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and deployed using Firebase. The objective is to dodge barriers and reach a destination, capturing the essence of classic games. While simple, it was born out of a desire for nostalgia and a love for game development. At the time of typing this, it's only optimized for Windows computer. </p>
